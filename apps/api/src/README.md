Hi! This is my website. I put most everything related to me on here. 

## Dependencies

- Node.js
- MongoDB

## Building

If for some reason you want to build this for yourself, clone it and run `npm install`, then `npm start` (or run `bin/www`). You'll have to have a `.env` file with a MONGOURL variable set.
